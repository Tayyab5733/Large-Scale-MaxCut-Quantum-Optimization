# QAOA for Max-Cut using Qiskit

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** using **Qiskit** to solve the **Max-Cut** problem, a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge. The implementation includes graph modeling, quantum circuit construction, transpilation for real quantum hardware, and execution using Qiskit Runtime Primitives.

## üß† About QAOA

**QAOA** is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. It leverages a parameterized quantum circuit (Ansatz) and classical optimization techniques to find approximate solutions. QAOA is particularly useful for problems that can be mapped to a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** model.

## üìå Problem: Max-Cut

Given a graph \( G = (V, E) \), the goal of the Max-Cut problem is to partition the set of vertices \( V \) into two disjoint subsets such that the number of edges connecting the subsets is maximized.
